The user will provide the following:
- `prompt`: What the course should be about (e.g., "Create a course about Python programming basics.")
- `chapters`: Number of chapters (e.g., `3`)
- `lessons_per_chapter`: Number of lessons in each chapter (e.g., `4`)
- `difficulty`: The course level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
